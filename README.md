# S2VRDemo

This is an example of how to use React 360 to create an interactive VR experience.

The page loads 3 panels, 1 to view selectable objects, another to view its respective information once selected, and the last to view a wallpaper image between the other two.

This demo should run on all devices including Oculus GO
